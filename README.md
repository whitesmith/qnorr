# Qnorr
It will be a fully modular webstarter kit, for creating & deploying static website/webapps.  
Right now is just a non-modular starter kit, but we'll get there.


### Requirements
1. A computer.
1. Node `>=v6.10.0` and `npm`.

### Installation

##### From `npm`
```
npm install -g qnorr
```

#####
 Directly [from gitHub](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17509669/how-to-install-an-npm-package-from-github-directly):
using ssh:
```bash

npm install -g git+ssh://git@github.com:whitesmith/qnorr.git 
```

using https:
```
npm install -g git+https://git@github.com:whitesmith/qnorr.git
```

or directly:
```
npm install -g https://github.com/whitesmith/qnorr
```

### Usage
To get started with a new project, just run `qnorr new <project-name>`. A new folder will be created under `project-name` with the default scaffolding and tools ([see below](#features)) for Qnorr, with git init-ed for you as well.

### Documentation
More documentation regarding deployment/usage can be found in the [README.md](blueprints/default/files/README.md) of your newly created project folder.

In future quick overview guides will be created for some specific packages (Templating, CriticalCSS to name a few), in the meantime refer to packages own docs `/shrug`

### Thanks
To all open-source packages listed on `package.json` (we'll put a comprehensive list here soon), [`inuitcss`](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss) for the ongoing css inspiration which is the foundation of this kit, [Google web starter kit](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit) which inspired the creation of this project and [`ember-cli`](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli) from which a lot is borrowed on how to make the installer work.
