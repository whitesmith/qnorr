# Quickie
It will be a fully modular webstarter kit, for creating & deploying static website/webapps.  
Right now is just a non-modular starter kit, but we'll get there. 


### Requirements
1. A computer.
1. Node `>=v6.10.0`.
1. Gulp.

### Setup
1. Install `node.js >=v6.10.0, (we suggest [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage your node versions)
1. Install [Gulp.js](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) `npm install --global gulp-cli`
1. Install dependencies `npm install`

### Usage
1. Clone this repo into your desired project folder
1. `npm start` or `npm run dev` or `gulp` to start development environment 
1. `npm run production` to start production environment 
1. `npm run build` to build a production environment folder

### Deploy
At the moment, only GitHub pages are supported to host your site/app. Maybe it makes sense to support other free platforms like [Now.sh](https://zeit.co/now) in a near future.

1. `npm run deploy` will do all the magic. It assumes your current git repo as the destination. 

Already bought a domain? ðŸ‘Œ

1. Add it to CNAME in the `src/CNAME` file. 
1. Config your domain register service to point to githubPages. Here's how to do it on [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages);
1. Deploy it again

### Documentation
In future quick overview guides will be created for some specific packages (Templating, CriticalCSS to name a few), in the meantime refer to packages own docs `/shrug`
