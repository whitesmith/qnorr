# <%= project_name %>
Your next static website, created using Quickie.

### Requirements
1. A computer.
1. Node `>=v6.10.0`.
1. Gulp.

### Setup
1. Install `node.js >=v6.10.0, (we suggest [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage your node versions)
1. Install [Gulp.js](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) `npm install --global gulp-cli`
1. Install dependencies `npm install`

### Usage
1. `npm start` or `npm run dev` or `gulp` to start development environment
1. `npm run production` to start production environment
1. `npm run build` to build a production environment folder

### Deploy
At the moment, only GitHub pages are supported to host your site/app. Maybe it makes sense to support other free platforms like [Now.sh](https://zeit.co/now) in a near future.

1. `npm run deploy` will do all the magic. It assumes your current git repo as the destination.
